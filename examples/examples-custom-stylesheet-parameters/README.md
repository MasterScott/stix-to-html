Purpose of "examples-custom-stylesheet-parameters"
===

The script bin/run_stix_to_html__with_custom_parameters.sh demonstrates how to call the stix-to-html xslt transform with stylesheet parameters.

This script uses the saxon xslt engine, but the same thing can be accomplished with other xslt engines, though the mechanics of passing parameters will vary.
